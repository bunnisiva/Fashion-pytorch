# Fashion-pytorch
This is famous dataset from zylanders . It is now in torch vision data collections 
I created my CNN model from scratch and got pretty good accuracy. This training is more for debug pupose. Basically I found that pytorch was truncating my test data from test loader from 32 to 16.
I tried different ways todebug and get the code to work through workaround.
I also tested this in 0.4 pytorch and 1.0 pytorch. The accuracy were quite off from each other , but the bug still there 
Please look for MARKDOWNS for details on going deeper into the tensor dimensions and narrowing in the problem so that we can actually understand what is happening under the hood
Very interesting . More to come on Computer vision pytorch projects.

I will be mimicking my NN in keras to see if the same problem exists there or it isjust one isolated situation in pytorch
will know soon!!!!!
thank you !!!!
